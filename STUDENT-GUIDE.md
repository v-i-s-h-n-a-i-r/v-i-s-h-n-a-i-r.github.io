# Student Lab Guide: React Portfolio Development

## üéØ Overview
This lab guide will walk you through setting up, customizing, and deploying your React portfolio. By the end, you'll have a professional portfolio website deployed on GitHub Pages!

## üìã Prerequisites
- Basic HTML/CSS knowledge
- Git basics (clone, commit, push)
- GitHub account
- Node.js installed on your computer

## üöÄ Lab Steps

### Phase 1: Setup and Exploration (30 minutes)

#### Step 1: Clone and Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-instructor/student-portfolio-react.git
cd student-portfolio-react

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm start
```

**üéØ Goal**: Get the project running locally and explore the structure.

#### Step 2: Explore the Codebase
1. Open the project in VS Code
2. Explore the folder structure:
   - `src/components/` - Reusable UI components
   - `src/pages/` - Different pages of your portfolio
   - `src/data/` - **Your content goes here!**
3. Look at how data flows from `data/` files to components

**‚úÖ Checkpoint**: You should see the template portfolio running at `http://localhost:3000`

### Phase 2: Personalization (45 minutes)

#### Step 3: Update Personal Information
Edit `src/data/personal.js`:
```javascript
export const personal = {
  name: "Your Full Name",
  role: "Software Engineering Student",
  bio: "Write a brief bio about yourself...",
  email: "your.email@example.com",
  phone: "+1 (555) 123-4567",
  location: "Your City, State",
  github: "https://github.com/yourusername",
  linkedin: "https://linkedin.com/in/yourusername",
  // ... update all fields
};
```

**üéØ Goal**: Replace all placeholder data with your real information.

#### Step 4: Add Your Projects
Edit `src/data/projects.js`:
1. Replace the sample projects with your own
2. For each project, include:
   - Clear title and description
   - Technologies used
   - GitHub repository link
   - Live demo link (if available)
3. Mark your best projects as `featured: true`

**üí° Tip**: If you don't have many projects yet, include class assignments, personal experiments, or tutorials you've completed.

#### Step 5: Update Certifications
Edit `src/data/certifications.js`:
1. Add any certifications you have
2. Include online courses from Coursera, Udemy, etc.
3. Add relevant skills for each certification

**‚úÖ Checkpoint**: Your portfolio should now show your personal information!

### Phase 3: Assets and Styling (30 minutes)

#### Step 6: Add Your Assets
Create these files in `public/assets/`:
1. `profile.jpg` - Your professional photo (square, 500x500px recommended)
2. `resume.pdf` - Your current resume
3. `project1.jpg`, `project2.jpg`, etc. - Screenshots of your projects

**üéØ Goal**: Replace placeholder images with your real content.

#### Step 7: Customize Colors (Optional)
Edit `tailwind.config.js` to change the color scheme:
```javascript
colors: {
  primary: {
    50: '#eff6ff',
    500: '#your-color',    // Change this
    600: '#your-color',    // And this
    700: '#your-color',    // And this
  }
}
```

**‚úÖ Checkpoint**: Your portfolio should look personalized with your content and assets.

### Phase 4: Git Workflow (30 minutes)

#### Step 8: Create Your Repository
1. Create a new repository on GitHub named `student-portfolio-react`
2. Make it public
3. Don't initialize with README (we already have one)

#### Step 9: Git Setup
```bash
# Remove existing git history
rm -rf .git

# Initialize new repository
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial portfolio setup"

# Connect to your GitHub repository
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/student-portfolio-react.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

**üéØ Goal**: Your personalized portfolio code is now in your GitHub repository.

### Phase 5: Deployment Setup (30 minutes)

#### Step 10: Configure for GitHub Pages
1. Edit `package.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "homepage": "https://yourusername.github.io/student-portfolio-react",
     ...
   }
   ```

2. Update `src/App.jsx` basename:
   ```javascript
   <Router basename="/student-portfolio-react">
   ```

#### Step 11: Enable GitHub Pages
1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click Settings ‚Üí Pages
3. Source: "GitHub Actions"
4. The workflow file is already included in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`

#### Step 12: Deploy
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Configure for GitHub Pages deployment"
git push origin main
```

**‚úÖ Checkpoint**: Your portfolio should be live at `https://yourusername.github.io/student-portfolio-react`

### Phase 6: Advanced Features (45 minutes)

#### Step 13: Add a New Project (Practice React)
1. Add a new project to `src/data/projects.js`
2. Create a feature branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b add-new-project
   ```
3. Commit and push:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add new project: [project name]"
   git push origin add-new-project
   ```
4. Create a Pull Request on GitHub
5. Merge the PR

**üéØ Goal**: Practice the full Git workflow and see the CI/CD in action.

#### Step 14: Customize Contact Form (Optional)
Modify `src/components/ContactForm.jsx`:
1. Add form validation
2. Integrate with a service like Formspree or Netlify Forms
3. Add more fields if needed

#### Step 15: SEO Optimization
Update `public/index.html`:
1. Change the title tag
2. Update meta description
3. Add Open Graph tags for social media sharing
